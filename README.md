AIM: to install Visual Studio Code and writing a program to print hello world, and calculator program 

Theory: VS code is a code editor that allows you to run all types of programs and codes if the suitable extensions are added. In the codes, MinGW is used to add the c++ extension
printing hello world uses the "cout" character output and the calculator program uses the sum(+), difference(-), multiplication(*), division(/) arithmetic operators.
